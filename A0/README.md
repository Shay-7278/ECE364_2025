# Assignment 0: Programming with Python

Welcome to the programming portion of the assignment! Each assignment throughout the semester will have a written portion and a programming portion. We will be using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb), so if you have never used it before, take a quick look through this [one-minute tutorial](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ANaoLv6HWze6RLm1Fvsv8qpHpM4GZGQb/view?usp=drive_link).



We'll also be programming in Python, which we will assume a basic familiarity with. Python has fantastic community support and we'll be using numerous packages for machine learning (ML) tasks. In this assignment, we're going to get familiar with [NumPy](https://numpy.org), a data handling library [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and one of the foundational building blocks of many ML libraries, and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org), which is used to programmatically construct graphs.


### Learning Objectives

1. Gain familiarity with the NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib packages

2. Practice using Google Colab, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks
s

If you have any issues with the packages, feel free to reference the docs for each package ([numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/1.19/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/contents.html)). 


***If you get stuck, please come to office hours, review the optional precept, or post on Canvas. We're here to help you succeed!***
